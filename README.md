# AI-in-optometric-practice-


This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence into optometric systems to assist in eye diagnostics and prescriptions. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze eye images and predict potential visual impairments, providing support to optometrists in faster and more accurate diagnosis.
